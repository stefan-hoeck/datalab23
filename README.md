# ADLS: Datalab Cheminformatics AS23

The goal of this part of this year's datalab is to implement a small
library of data types and algorithms to be used in the field of
cheminformatics *from scratch*, that is, without using or importing
any existing libraries unless explicitly specified.

Work through the exercises in the following order:

* `Atom.py`
* `Formula.py`
* `Molecule.py`

Depending on how it's going, more tasks will be added throughout the
course.

Hand in your results as plain Python (`.py`) files. Don't hand in
Jupyter notebook files or similar. Don't hand in files specific to your
developing environment.

Your code will be marked according to the following criteria:

* Your code should be clean and well documented
* Your code should strictly adhere to the specifications given
* Your code should be efficient
* You should test your code for correctness in *separate source files* or
  via doctests. Do not pollute your library with code that automatically
  produces output.
